# Multi-Threading-Example

This is my C multi-threading example. I have other more impressive academic projects in multithreading but I was terrible with commenting my work at the time and I have long since forgotten how to build and run them. This was the smallest most concise example of my C language multi-threading knowledge.

I would like to say, I absolutely LOVED multithreading work. My Operating Systems course was my favorite CS course. I loved C, memory management, multi-threading, etc.. It was just cool for me to manipulate the hardware like that to get faster results.

This assignment had starter code, the mandelbrot code was handed to us by the TA. The p_main.c file is where I created a new copy of the original main.c and did all my work.

The main.c is the original serialized version of the code. The p_main.c is where I used pthreads to multithread the process. Also, this was a paired assignment but my partner didnt contribute at all unfortunately. I wrote the entire pthreading code.

This is built for macOS, you can build the source for Linux as well. I honestly cannot explain how the parameters work. I would just say run this command:

./p_main 0 0 1

The TA explained the concept in class at the time (Spring 2017).
