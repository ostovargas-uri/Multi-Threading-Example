Download the serial version of the Mandelbrot Plotter from the PThreads Lab Exercise folder on Sakai..

The Mandelbrot set is the set of all complex numbers where the function fc(z)=z2+c does not diverge when iterated from z=0.

For the remainder of class work on implementing a parallel version of the provided serial one.

You may work in groups of 2, if you would like.

Measure the speedup and efficiency of your implementation vs. the provided serial one.

When you are done you may leave but upload your implementation to Sakai
